# New York Stop, Question and Frisk
The New York Police Department are conducting a review of their stop, question and frisk (SQF) policy. You have been enlisted as a consultant and tasked to conduct an analysis of their data from 2020.

You should use appropriate data processing and analysis methods to produce an overview report which summarises the patterns revealed in the data in this year. It is expected that at least some of the methods you use will relate to the spatial dimensions of the data.

Your report should include a brief introduction including relevant contextual information at the beginning and a critical review of your findings at the end. You must include at least one map.
