# New York Stop, Question and Frisk
This project aims to conduct a review of New York Police Department's stop, question and frisk (SQF) policy by using their data from 2020.

The appropriate data processing and analysis methods are used to produce an overview report which summarises the patterns revealed in the data in this year. Some of the methods utilised relate to the spatial dimensions of the data.

The report includes a brief introduction including relevant contextual information at the beginning and a critical review of the findings at the end with geospatial maps.
